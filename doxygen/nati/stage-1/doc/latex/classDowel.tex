\subsection{Detailed Description}
A \hyperlink{classDowel}{Dowel} is a cylindrical peace of wood. I have seeral Dowels as stock material. For production pieces are cut from the dowels. After a cut is done there exist two Dowels\-: The original one which is shorter now, a \char`\"{}new\char`\"{} \hyperlink{classDowel}{Dowel} to be used in production. This Dowels are cut in twobe used in production of some furniture All my Dowels have the same diameter, but the have differnt length.

The length of a \hyperlink{classDowel}{Dowel} changes when it gets cut by a saw. I want to nurror the physical world in this program. A \hyperlink{classDowel}{Dowel} is not able to cut itself. A saw does the cut. The saw should change (shorten) the length of a \hyperlink{classDowel}{Dowel}. As I want to model the physical world in this program, a saw should be able to shorten a \hyperlink{classDowel}{Dowel}, but this function should not be available to everybody. A \hyperlink{classDowel}{Dowel} can not cut itself, a tool does the work.
